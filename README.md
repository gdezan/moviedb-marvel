## Running

To run this application locally, first install the node dependencies with yarn:

```
yarn install
```

Then, we need to set up the environment variables. You can do that by copying the `.env.dev` file and setting the necessary fields.

```bash
cp .env.dev .env
```

Once that is done, you can run the server locally by executing the command

```
yarn dev
```

or by building and running the Docker image specified by the Dockerfile.

The server will open up on `http://localhost:8080`.
